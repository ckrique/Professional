Full System Analyst Developer, CTIS/Sonda IT Brasil  - January/2016  - December/2016- Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro
 
Sonda Technology is a South American giant in the IT consulting field. In Brazil, it operates in large public companies such as Petrobras. When I had the opportunity to work for Sonda Tecnologia, I worked on a project related to a contract with the secretariat of education of the city of Rio de Janeiro, when I had to maintain and implement evolutions in the management system of that office. .NET Webforms System.
·         I have developed and maintained many SQL Server stored procedures. Most of the business logic of the systems was in the database. That way it was necessary to create procedures and remove many bugs using Transact SQL encoding.
·         My biggest challenge overcome in this opportunity was the creation of a virtual agenda and with a somewhat complex graphical interface using Jquery, C #, SQL Server and HTML. Through this agenda teachers (users of the system) can schedule and mark classes beyond the normal grade of classes.
·         At that time I was part of an agile team for the first time and was performing deliveries in SCRUM Sprints.
